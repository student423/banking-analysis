## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Banking Analysis Dashboard** built using real-world banking data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from customer loan and deposit behavior to help financial institutions make informed decisions.

**Tools Used:**
- SQL – For data extraction and preprocessing  
- Python (Pandas & Matplotlib) – For cleaning, transformation, and EDA  
- Power BI – For advanced data visualization and interactive dashboard creation

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern banks handle huge volumes of customer data, but often struggle to:
- Understand **loan distribution patterns** across customer segments  
- Analyze **deposit trends** based on occupation, income, and bank type  
- Track **engagement and credit card usage**

There is a need for an **intuitive dashboard** to help bank executives analyze customer behavior and improve decision-making.

## 🛠️ Solution Approach

The project was developed in **three major steps**:

### 1. Data Processing with SQL + Python
- Extracted relevant records using SQL queries
- Used **Pandas** to clean nulls, format currency, and normalize fields
- Performed EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations

### 2. Dashboard Development in Power BI
- Created KPIs: Total Loan, Deposit, Fees, Clients, Credit Card Count
- Built multiple pages: **Loan Analysis**, **Deposit Analysis**, and **Summary**
- Included slicers for **Year**, **Gender**, **Bank Type**, and **Advisors**
- Interactive charts like bar plots, pie charts, and filters for dynamic exploration
